## IMDB-5000 Dataset

* This is a classification task in which we build and train a model to classify if a movie is terrible, bad, good or excellent based on many inputs.

* We built and trained several models (Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbours, support vector machine, random forest regression and neural network) evaluated each via 10-fold cross validation.

* The best performaing model was the random forest regression model, with an average accuracy of 67%.
